### Building the project

**TBD**

This project uses Expo as the build tool. For more information, refer to the following resources:

- [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/): Learn the fundamentals or explore advanced topics with our [guides](https://docs.expo.dev/guides).
- [Learn Expo tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/): Follow a step-by-step tutorial to create a project that runs on Android, iOS, and the web. 

### Different Expo Builds

Expo provides different types of builds to suit various development and production needs:

- **Development Builds**: These builds are used during the development phase. They include debugging tools and are not optimized for performance. They allow you to test your app on a device or emulator with live reloading and other development features.
- **Production Builds**: These builds are optimized for performance and are intended for distribution to end users. They do not include debugging tools and are optimized for speed and efficiency.
- **Custom Builds**: These builds allow you to include custom native code or third-party libraries that are not included in the standard Expo SDK. They provide more flexibility but require more setup and maintenance.

For more information on how to create and use these builds, refer to the Expo documentation:
- [Development Builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Production Builds](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/building-standalone-apps/)
- [Custom Builds](https://docs.expo.dev/development/customizing/)
